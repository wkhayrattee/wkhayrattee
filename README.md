### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wasseem Khayrattee. I live on the beautiful island named as Mauritius.

I have a BSc(Hons) in Information technology, with over 15 years of professional experience in Web/Digital world.
I have been focusing on WordPress & its ecosystem for the last 6yrs+. And also created a couple of WordPress projects & plugins.

If it matters:

I was [interviewed here](https://hostnoc.com/interview-with-wasseem-khayrattee/) and I was also featured on one of the famous PHP magazine, namely PHP[architect] for their November 2021 edition - [you can read the intro here!](https://www.phparch.com/article/community-corner-interview-with-wasseem-khayrattee/).
