### Hey there 👋

My name is [**Wasseem Khayrattee**](https://wk.contact) - mostly known to my PHP circles as: [**7PHP**](https://twitter.com/7php). I call the stunning island of [**Mauritius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius) my home.

With a BSc(Hons) in Information Technology and over 15 years of professional experience in the digital realm, I've been deeply immersed in the PHP universe throughout my journey.

While my WordPress adventure began in 2006 when I adopted it as my go-to self-hosted blogging platform, the past 8 years have seen me laser-focused on honing my development skills within the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem. Here's a snapshot of what I've been up to:

* 🔌 Crafting plugins that enhance WordPress functionality.
* 🎨 Extending themes to create visually stunning websites.
* 🌐 Syncing data seamlessly between WordPress and various APIs.
* 🏗️ Architecting robust WordPress systems – I've even devised my own [WordPress with Composer approach](https://github.com/wkhayrattee/wordpress-with-composer), inspired by the 12-factor methodology.
* 🚀 Managing deployments with a zero-downtime strategy; my toolkit includes heavy bash scripting and Python-based scripts using Fab.
* 🛠️ Overseeing DevOps aspects – from setting up WordPress on VPS, whether it's building from scratch on DigitalOcean's cloud or opting for managed hosting through Kinsta and WPEngine.
* 🤖 Automating provisioning processes using a blend of bash scripting, Ansible, and partially Terraform.


And in case you're curious:

I had the privilege of being [interviewed here](https://hostnoc.com/interview-with-wasseem-khayrattee/). I was also featured in the renowned PHP[architect] magazine, gracing their November 2021 edition – you can [catch a glimpse of it here](https://www.phparch.com/article/community-corner-interview-with-wasseem-khayrattee/)!
