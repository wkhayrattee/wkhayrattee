### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [**Wasseem Khayrattee**](https://wk.contact) - mostly known to my PHP circles as **'7PHP'**. I live on the beautiful island named as **Mauritius**.

I have a BSc(Hons) in Information technology, with over 15 years of professional experience in Web/Digital world - most of which has been PHP-based all the way. 

I have been focusing on WordPress & its ecosystem (including WooCommerce) for the last 6yrs: 
- creating plugins
- syncing data to APIs from WordPress
- architecturing WordPress systems - I use my [WordPress with Composer approach](https://github.com/wkhayrattee/wordpress-with-composer) (a close attempt to meet the 12-factor approach)
- handling deployments with zero-downtime strategy (heavy bash scripting and python-based scripting using Fab)
- handling the DevOPs aspects - hosting WordPress on VPS; both from scratch using DigitalOcean cloud, as well as Managed hosting using **Kinsta** and **WPEngine**.
- automating the provisioning process using Ansible & partly Terraform

If it matters:

I was [interviewed here](https://hostnoc.com/interview-with-wasseem-khayrattee/) and I was also featured on one of the famous PHP magazine, namely **the PHP[architect] magazine**, for their November 2021 edition - [you can read the intro here!](https://www.phparch.com/article/community-corner-interview-with-wasseem-khayrattee/).
